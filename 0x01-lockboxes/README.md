# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Mock Technical Interview Question

## Description
* You have a collection of locked boxes, each represented as a list. Each box contains keys that can unlock other boxes. The goal is to determine if all the boxes can be opened.

## Problem statement
* Given a list of boxes (boxes), where each box is represented by a list of keys (positive integers), write a function canUnlockAll(boxes) that returns True if all boxes can be opened, and False otherwise. The first box (boxes[0]) is already unlocked.
