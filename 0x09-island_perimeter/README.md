# 0x09. Island Perimeter
## Project goal
* Calculate the perimeter of a single island grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers.
* The project requires an understanding of the following concepts
  * Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2-dimensional array.
  * Understanding logical operations and conditional statements to determine whether the sides of a cell are part of the    island perimeter and check the status of the adjacent cell.
