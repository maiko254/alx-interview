# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Project goals
* This projects aim is to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding
  
  * It will demonstrate how to handle and manipulate bit in python and BitWise operators.
  * Understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme.
  * Data Representation
    
    * How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
    * Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.
  * General python programming concepts such as working with Lists and Boolean logic to control program flow.
